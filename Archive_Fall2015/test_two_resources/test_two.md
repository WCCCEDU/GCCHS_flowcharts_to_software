#### Intro to Programming Test Two
Moar Javascript
###### 1. Declare a well named variable that will store the how many seats are in a new brand of car.

<br/><br/>
###### 2. Declare a well named variable that will hold the make and model of our new brand of car. Then initialize it with a value of type that would be consistant with the make and model of a car.

<br/><br/>
###### 3. Write the identify function.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

###### 4. Write a loop that has 5 iterations and begins at the variable "start".
```
var start = 0
```
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

###### 5. Hand Evaluate and simplify this code line by line. (Identify if values are numbers or strings as you go)
```
var addAreaCode412 = function(phoneNumber){
  return "412" + phoneNumber;
};

var numberWithAreaCode = addAreaCode412(5551212);
var htmlOutput = "<div>"+numberWithAreaCode+"</div>";
document.write(htmlOutput);
```

###### 6. Write a Hi-Lo Game in JavaScript.
```
// Assume that a function called createRandomNumber(beginning, end) exists that accepts as arguments the
// beginning and end of the range of values and returns a whole number between that range inclusively.
//
// The Hi-Lo game selects a random number and then continues to ask the player to enter a number.
// If the user choice is higher than the random number chosen by the system it should tell the player "Too High".
// If the user choice is lower than the random number chosen by the system it should tell the player "Too Low".
// If the user choice is equal to the random number chosen by the system it should inform them they won.
// and stop asking for new values.
// As long as the user has not chosen the correct value the program should repeat.
```
